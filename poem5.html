        One sadden moment I read your poetry,
        <br>
        Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,
        <br>
        What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.
        <br>
        Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,
        <br>
        <br>
        A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,
        <br>
        Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,
        <br>
        Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,
        <br>
        Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,
        <br>
        Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,
        <br>
        Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,
        <br>
        Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my   dearpoet.
